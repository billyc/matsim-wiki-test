# MATSim code examples

Welcome to the Wiki. The purpose of the documents and pages here are to be a _link between_ the high level discussion of the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) toolkit that you will find in the [MATSim book and user guide](https://matsim.org/content/matsim-book-and-users-guide), and the implementation details you will find in the code and associated _Javadoc_ itself.
